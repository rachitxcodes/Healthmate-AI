# 🩺 HealthMate AI  
### Generative AI Powered Preventive Healthcare Assistant

HealthMate AI is an intelligent healthcare web application that transforms medical reports into AI-generated health insights. It combines OCR, Machine Learning, and Generative AI to predict disease risks and explain medical data in simple, understandable language.

## 🚀 Problem

Medical reports contain complex clinical values (CBC, glucose, cholesterol, etc.), but:

- Most patients cannot interpret medical terminology
- Reports provide raw numbers without explanations
- Early disease risks often go unnoticed
- There is a gap between diagnostics and preventive action

---

## 💡 Solution

HealthMate AI converts static medical reports into:

- 📊 Structured health data (via OCR)
- 🧠 Disease risk predictions (ML model)
- 🗣 AI-generated medical explanations (LLM API)
- 🛡 Personalized preventive recommendations
- 🤖 Conversational AI health companion

## 🔬 How It Works

1. User uploads a medical report image.
2. OCR extracts key medical parameters.
3. Extracted values are passed to a trained ML model.
4. The model predicts disease risk probability.
5. Generative AI explains:
   - What the values mean
   - Why the risk exists
   - What preventive actions to take
6. User can chat with AI for further clarification.
